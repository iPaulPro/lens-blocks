## Introduction

Lens Blocks is a [shadcn/ui Registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) of useful social React components using the official [Lens React SDK](https://lens.xyz/docs/protocol/getting-started/react), [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

The registry includes essentials like a [wallet-aware login button](https://lensblocks.com/blocks/login) (using viem/wagmi), a full-featured [post component](https://lensblocks.com/blocks/post) (markdown, mentions, reactions, collects, tips), a [follow button](https://lensblocks.com/components/follow-button), and a [WYSIWYG composer/editor](https://lensblocks.com/components/text-editor).

Each block deeply integrates with the Lens React SDK and handles wallet connection, signing, authentication, session lifecycle, optimistic updates, and state management out of the box.
